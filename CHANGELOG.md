# Changelog

## [0.8.0](https://pypi.pthon.org/pypi/is-valid/0.8.0) - 2019/04/10
- Refactored automatic predicate conversion to convert `dict`, `tuple`, and
`list` instances to `is_dict_where`, `is_tuple_where`, and `is_list_where`
respectively. For normal data this should be functionally equivalent but now
you can nest other predicates inside this data.
- Moved `to_pred` from `is_eq` to it's own module.
- Simplify `assert_valid` into just an assertion function instead of a function
generator.

## [0.7.1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/is-valid/0.7.1) - 2018/07/03
- Refactored `is_json_where`, and `is_json`.
- Added `is_bytes`, `is_decodable_where`, and `is_decodable`.

## [0.7.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/is-valid/0.7.0) - 2018/03/01
- Made assertions generated by `assert_valid` accept context arguments. These
will then be forwarded to the underlying predicate. The `assert_valid` class
itself also accepts a context argument in it's constructor that serves as a
base context for the generated assertion.
- Simplified `is_tranformed` and `is_json_where` a bit. This change is
backwards incompatible.
- Simplified `utils.Wrapper` to only wrap predicates. This way predicate
testing using isinstance works for wrapper predicates as well.

## [0.6.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/is-valid/0.6.0) - 2018/01/17
- `Wrapper` class has been updated, it now doesn't just wrap function calls but
also underlying attributes of the wrapped object. You now change what is
wrapped by calling `Wrapper.wrap(obj)` instead of `Wrapper.func = obj`.
- The dict predicates (`is_dict_where`, `is_superdict_where`,
`is_subdict_where`) saw a small overhaul in how their explanation objects work.
Instead of just giving an explanation that the keys are incorrect with details
about which keys are extra and which are missing the explanation now gives
explanation objects that state `not_allowed` or `missing` for these keys
while also evaluating the keys that were present and could be evaluated.
- `is_iterable_where` and it's subclasses (`is_tuple_of`, `is_list_of`) saw a
small overhaul in how their explanation objects work. Instead of just giving an
explanation that the length is incorrect the explanation now gives explanation
objects that state `overflow` or `missing` for when data is too long or too
short for the incorrect indexes while also evaluating the elements that were
present and could be evaluated.
- Transform methods were added to `is_cond`, with `trans_cond` and `trans_pred`
you can alter the data before it gets entered into the conds or preds
respectively. By default they just do nothing with the data.
- `is_with` was added. Here you specify a dict of keys mapping to functions and
a predicate that then stores the output of that function when the data gets
entered for that key. Then in the following predicate you can use `Get`-objects
to reference to that specific key. See the tests for a good example.
- `is_byte` was added which checks for an int in range 0 to 255.

## [0.5.1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/is-valid/0.5.1) - 2018/01/12
- Fix bug where `is_dict_of` didn't check if the value was a dict beforehand
but only if it was iterable, thus leading to an exception being thrown when a
value was evaluated that was iterable but not a dict.

## [0.5.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/is-valid/0.5.0) - 2018/01/12
- Introduction of this changelog.
- `is_dict_where` now also accepts two dicts as arguments to indicate
required and optional keys respectively.
- The `dict` method on `Explanation` objects now has an extra keyword argument
`include_details=True` to specify if you want it to put the details in the
dict. Also if the details are some kind of structure made up out of dicts,
lists and tuples it now traverses these structures to also convert all
`Explanation` objects within them to dicts. (Small breaking change)
- `Wrapper` utility class introduced, this just wraps a function that you can
change at any moment by setting the `func`-attribute. Useful for when you want
some kind of recursion in your predicate structure.
- Predicate classes `is_optional` and `is_nullable` were added, given a
predicate they become a predicate that holds when either the given predicate
holds or the value is `None`. There are two versions because `is_optional` and
`is_nullable` use `is_none` and `is_null` under the hood respectively.
- `is_cond` now wraps its conds and preds with `is_eq` when they are not
callable. Consistency :)
- Almost complete rewrite without breaking any compatibility making all
predicates be instances of a subclass of `is_valid.base.Predicate` instead of
loose functions. This allows for some neat small things:
    - You can now use `~pred` instead of `is_not(pred)`, also
    `is_not(is_not(pred))` just gives back `pred` now.
    - You can now use `pred1 | pred2` instead of `is_any(pred1, pred2)`, also
    `is_any(pred1, is_any(pred2, pred3))` does the same as
    `is_any(pred1, pred2, pred3)` now.
    - You can now use `pred1 & pred2` instead of `is_all(pred1, pred2)`, also
    `is_all(pred1, is_all(pred2, pred3))` does the same as
    `is_all(pred1, pred2, pred3)` now.
    - You can now use `pred.explain(value)` instead of
    `pred(value, explain=True)`.

## [0.4.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/is-valid/0.4.0) - 2017/11/26
- Latest version before introduction of this changelog.
